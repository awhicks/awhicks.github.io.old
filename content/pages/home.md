I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech.  I grew up in Winchester, VA and I graduated from the University of Virignia in 2020 with a double major in Computer Science and History.  My current research is in Computer Science Education and I am adivsed by Dr. Clifford Shaffer.

I have had several internships, with [The Library Corporation](https://tlcdelivers.com/) and the [McKesson Corporation](https://www.mckesson.com/), where I worked on cybersecurity and front-end and API development.

This past year at Virginia Tech I have been involved with [CS Graduate Council](https://csgrad.cs.vt.edu/) where I have helped to organize events and attended meetings.  Next year I will be serving as the Vice President to continue my work.
