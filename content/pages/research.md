### Digital Education Lab at Virginia Tech
- I have been a Graduate Research Assistant with Dr. Clifford Shaffer since Summer 2020.
- My work thus far has been upgrading the [OpenDSA](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/) infrastructure using Docker to provide a more portable development environment as well as reorganizing the production deployment to use containers.
- I also helped upgrade OpenDSA to Rails v6 as well as providing various bugfixes.
- My current work involves studying new strategies for automated student feedback.
- I will be working to containerize the feedback generation and analysis plugins from (Web-CAT)[https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/Web-CAT/WebObjects/Web-CAT.woa] for use in other automated grading systems.

### Projects

##### LTI Live Catalog
- I helped create to a live catalog of smart learning objects for CS Education using the LTI protocol

##### Meals on Wheels
- Our team redesigned the web portal that the Charlottesville branch of Meals on Wheels uses for their volunteer management
- This project was my senior capstone at UVA.

##### Rebu
- Rebu is a web app that connects home chefs to customers searching for a good, home cooked meal.
- This app was a project for an Internet Scale Applications course at UVA where I learned several new technologies including containerization using Docker, batch processing, MapReduce, and more.
