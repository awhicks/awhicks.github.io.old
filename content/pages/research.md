### Digital Education Lab at Virginia Tech
- I have been a Graduate Research Assistant with Dr. Clifford Shaffer since Summer 2020.
- My work thus far has been upgrading the [OpenDSA](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/) infrastructure using Docker to provide a more portable development environment as well as reorganizing the production deployment to use containers.
- I also helped upgrade OpenDSA to Rails v6 as well as providing various bugfixes.
